```diff
- This project demonstrates how to integrate Docker, GitHub Actions, Java Spring Boot, and Dokku to create an automated development and deployment workflow.

- The application is a basic Spring Boot service running inside a Docker container, automated with GitHub Actions, and deployed using Dokku.
```

## 1️⃣🟥 Features

*⚡️ Docker:*

Packages the Spring Boot application in a container to ensure it runs consistently in any environment.

*⚡️ GitHub Actions:*

Automates the build, test, and deployment processes for the application with each change in the repository.

*⚡️ Java Spring Boot:*

Backend framework for web application development.

*⚡️ Dokku:*

A Heroku-like deployment platform that uses Docker containers to manage applications easily.

### Differences between DockerGHA 1, 2, 3, and 4:

*All Dockerfiles are identical:*

- Use the base image busybox:latest.

- Copy a run.sh script into the container, which prints the current time in the console in an infinite loop.

- Configure the run.sh script as the container's entry point.


*Main.yml - General differences:*

1. Repositories:


- 1 and 2 push images only to Docker Hub.

- 3 pushes only to GHCR.

- 4 pushes to both registries (Docker Hub and GHCR).


2. Automation:

- Repositories 2, 3, and 4 use docker/metadata-action for automatic tagging, while 1 does not.


3. Image names:

- Repository 1 has a fixed name: clockbox:latest.

- The other repositories use dynamic or specific configurations.

*💾 Dockerfile:*

Defines how to build the Docker image for the Spring Boot project.

*💾 main.yml:*

GitHub Actions configuration file to automate building, testing, and deployment.

*💾 src/:*

Contains the source code for the Spring Boot application.

*💾 pom.xml:*

Maven configuration file for dependencies and project build.

*💾 dokku-deploy.sh:*

Script that automates the deployment process of the application to a remote server using Dokku.

## 3️⃣🟩 Objectives of the Project

The purpose of this repository is to demonstrate the use of Docker, GitHub Actions, and Dokku in a unified DevOps workflow for building, testing, and deploying applications.

This workflow is highly modular and follows standard practices to ensure scalability and automation:

Containerize the application using Docker.

Implement CI/CD pipelines using GitHub Actions.

Automate deployment processes via Dokku.

## 4️⃣🟨 Technologies Used

*Backend:*

💡Java Spring Boot: Provides a framework for developing microservices and REST APIs.

*Containers:*

💡Docker: Used to create, deploy, and run the application in containers, ensuring consistency across environments.

*Automation:*

💡GitHub Actions: Configured to automate the build, test, and deployment processes.

*Deployment:*

💡Dokku: Used to manage and deploy the application to a virtualized environment, simplifying application hosting.

*Others:*

💡Nginx: Used as a reverse proxy for the application to enhance performance and security.
